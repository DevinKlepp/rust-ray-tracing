My implementation of [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) in Rust

This is my first attempt at a Rust project, and it combines my interests in learning more about graphics as well as the Rust language itself.

To run:

```bash
cargo run > image.ppm
```
